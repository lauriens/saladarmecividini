# Sala d'Arme Cividini HEMA Academy's Website

Dev Laurien and Gabriel's (Sala d'Arme's main instructor and founder) girlfriend speaking :)

I'm using the academy's website as a tool to practice my frontend skills, with a framework I've used before, but very little: VueJS.

The academy itself is an Italian-tradition focused HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) academy.

In this repository, I've been playing with a couple of different layout styles (as I'm not a designer myself), and I'm "storing" them in different branches:

main: the first one I coded, very simple black background, with a horizontal menu for different informative pages

feature/pictures: style suggested by Gabriel, using pictures as backgrounds, in a more modern layout style

feature/colors: suggested by our friend Pedro, as a joke, give the user the option of choosing a black, white or colorful background - TODO
